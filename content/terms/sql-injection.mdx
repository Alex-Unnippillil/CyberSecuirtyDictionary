SQL injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to interfere with an application's queries to its database by inserting malicious SQL statements. Injection flaws occur when user-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized before being included in a query[^1]. NIST's Computer Security Resource Center describes SQL injection attacks as targeting websites that pass insufficiently processed user input to database back-ends[^2].
