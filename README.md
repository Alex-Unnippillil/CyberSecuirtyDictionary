## Build your own glossary

You can create your own glossary using this project as a starting point.

1. On GitHub, click **Use this template** to generate a new repository.
2. Clone your new repository locally and install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Add or edit terms in `terms.json` or the files under `data/`.
4. Run `npm run build` to generate the static site, or `npm run watch` to rebuild on changes.
5. Commit your changes and enable GitHub Pages for your repository to publish your glossary.

This project can be forked as well, but using the template option keeps the commit history focused on your version.
