## Importing terms

Sample adapters for converting CSV, YAML, or JSON data into the internal term
format are available under [`tools/importers`](tools/importers/). The internal
format expects each term to provide a `term`, `definition`, and a list of
`tags`. See the importer README for usage examples and sample source files.
