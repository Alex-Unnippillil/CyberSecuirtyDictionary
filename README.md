## Security
For information on reporting vulnerabilities, please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

## oEmbed
Static oEmbed responses are available for each term. These files live under the
`oembed/` directory and can be used by platforms that support oEmbed to preview
dictionary entries.

For example, the term **Phishing** exposes an oEmbed response at:

```
https://alex-unnippillil.github.io/CyberSecuirtyDictionary/oembed/phishing.json
```

To embed a term, link to `#Term` on the main site (e.g.
`https://alex-unnippillil.github.io/CyberSecuirtyDictionary/#Phishing`). The
page automatically advertises the corresponding oEmbed URL for unfurling.
