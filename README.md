## Development

This project includes a [development container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) for use with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or the VS Code Dev Containers extension.

- **Node.js 20** with `pnpm` is provided via devcontainer features.
- **Playwright** browser dependencies are preinstalled for running end-to-end tests.
- When the container starts, it runs `pnpm exec http-server -p 8080 .` so the site is served on <http://localhost:8080/>.
- Codespaces automatically forwards this port and opens a browser preview.

Opening the repository in Codespaces will install dependencies and launch the dev server automatically, letting you start developing right away.
