      <h2>Creation</h2>
      <p>
        New terms start in the <strong>draft</strong> stage. Draft entries
        include a proposed definition and sources for review.
      </p>
      <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>
        Draft terms are reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and sourcing. Once
        approved, a term's stage is set to <strong>reviewed</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>Deprecation</h2>
      <p>
        Reviewed terms may later become outdated. Such entries move to the
        <strong>deprecated</strong> stage but remain visible with a note about
        their status.
      </p>
      <h2>Archival</h2>
      <p>
        Deprecated terms that are no longer relevant are
        <strong>archived</strong>. Archived entries are kept for historical
        reference but are hidden from normal browsing.
