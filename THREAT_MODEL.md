# Threat Model

This document outlines potential threats and recommended mitigations for the Cyber Security Dictionary project.

## Authentication and Session Handling
- **Threat:** Missing or improperly validated authentication headers can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation:** Ensure strict validation of all authentication headers and avoid assumptions about the existence of user sessions. Reject requests with malformed or spoofed headers.

## Header Spoofing
- **Threat:** Attackers may attempt to spoof headers such as `X-Forwarded-For` or `Authorization` to bypass security checks.
- **Mitigation:** Do not rely solely on client-supplied headers for security decisions. Use server-side mechanisms to verify the source and integrity of requests.

## Recent Advisories
- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** Ensure middleware and proxies are configured to prevent smuggling attacks.
- **Session Fixation:** Rotate session identifiers after authentication to prevent fixation.

## Logging and Monitoring
- **Threat:** Insufficient logging can hinder detection of attacks.
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive logging of authentication attempts and header anomalies. Monitor logs for suspicious patterns.

## Defense in Depth
- Validate all inputs, sanitize outputs, and apply the principle of least privilege for any future server components.
