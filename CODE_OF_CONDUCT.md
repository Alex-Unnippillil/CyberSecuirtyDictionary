# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to alex.unnippillil@hotmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
