# Cybersecurity Dictionary Extension

This browser extension highlights cybersecurity terms on any web page and shows their definitions on hover. All data is loaded from a local `terms.json` file so the extension works completely offline.

## Installation

1. Open the browser's extensions page (e.g. `chrome://extensions`).
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Choose **Load unpacked** and select this repository's `extension` folder.
4. Open `extension/demo.html` to test the extension offline.

## Usage

The extension scans pages for terms from the included dictionary. Any matching words are highlighted. Hover over a highlighted term to see its definition.
